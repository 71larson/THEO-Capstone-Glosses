# # Sentences 2.18.1-3, 7

### Chapter 1

1. ON THE FORMATION OF WOMAN. And in the same paradise, God formed a woman from the substance of the man. After the planting of paradise and the placing of man in it, and after all the animals had been brought before him and had been designated by their names, Scripture adds: God cast Adam into a deep sleep and, as he slept, took one of his ribs and formed it into a woman. 
2. WHY HE FIRST CREATED MAN, AND AFTERWARDS THE WOMAN FROM THE MAN, AND NOT BOTH AT ONCE. Here we must attend to why he did not create man and woman at the same time, as with the angels, but first created the man, and afterwards the woman from the man. For this reason: namely that there should be one beginning of humankind, so that the devil’s pride should be confounded in this and the lowliness of human nature be raised by its likeness to God. For the devil had desired to be one beginning other than God; in order that the devil’s pride might be blunted, man received in gift that which the devil had perversely wanted to steal, but was not able to obtain. And through this, the image of God appeared in the man because, as Go was the beginning of creation for all things, so the man was the beginning of generation for all men.
3. ANOTHER REASON WHY ALL HUMAN BEINGS ARE FROM THE ONE MAN. God also willed all human beings to be from the one man so that, recognizing that they are all from one, they might love each other as if one. 

### Chapter 2

WHY WOMAN WAS FORMED FROM THE MAN’S SIDE AND NOT FROM SOME OTHER PART OF HIS BODY. But although woman was made from man for these reasons, nevertheless she was formed not from just any part of his body, but from his side, so that it should be shown that she was created for the partnership of love, lest, if perhaps she had been made from his head, she should be perceived as set over man in domination; or if from his feet, as if subject to him in servitude. Therefore, since she was made neither to dominate, nor to serve the man, but as his partner, she had to be produced neither from his head, nor from his feet, but from his side, so that he would know that she was to be placed beside himself whom he had learned had been taken from his side. 

### Chapter 3

1. WHY THE RIB WAS TAKEN FROM THE MAN WHILE ASLEEP AND NOT WHILE AWAKE. It was also not without cause that the rib was taken from the man while asleep rather than while awake from which the woman was made in order to be of help to man in generation. This was done so that it might be demonstrated that he was undergoing no punishment by this, and at the same time a wonderful work of divine power was shown, a power which opened the side of the sleeping man, and yet did not arouse him from the repose of sleep.
2. ON THE SACRAMENT OF THIS WORK. In this work, the sacrament of Christ and his Church is also prefigured. For just as the woman was formed from the side of the sleeping man, so the Church was formed from the sacraments which flowed from the side of Christ sleeping on the cross, namely blood and water, by which we are redeemed from punishments and washed clean of our faults.

### Chapter 7

1. ON THE SOUL OF THE WOMAN: THAT IT IS NOT FROM THE MAN’S SOUL, AS SOME HELD, WHO SAY THAT SOULS DERIVE FROM ONE ANOTHER. As the body of the woman was derived from the body of the man, so some believed that her soul was propagated from the man’s soul, and that all souls other than the first, like bodies, are derived from one another. – THE OPINION OF OTHERS WHO HELD THAT ALL SOULS WERE CREATED SIMULTANEOUSLY FROM THE BEGINNING. But others held that all souls were created simultaneously from the beginning.
2. THE SENTENCE OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. But the Catholic Church teaches neither that souls were made simultaneously, nor from one another, but that they are infused into bodies which have been inseminated and formed through coition, and they are created at the moment of their infusion.
3. HERE ARE REJECTED TWO FALSE OPINIONS AND THE SENTENCE OF THE CHURCH IS CONFIRMED. – AUTHORITY OF GENNADIUS. Hence in On Ecclesiastical Dogmas: “We do not say that human souls existed from beginning among the other intellectual natures, or that they were created all at once, as Origen falsely states. Neither are souls inseminated with the bodies through coition, as the Luciferians, and Cyril, and some presumptuous Latins affirm. We say that the body alone is inseminated by the conjugal union, but that the Creator alone knows the creation of the soul. It is by his judgement that the body is composed, brought together, and formed in the womb; once the body is formed, the soul is created and infused, so that in the womb lives a human being composed of body and soul, and a living person comes from the womb, filled with human substance.”
4. Jerome also condemns under the bond of anathema those who say that souls are derived from one another; he adduces the authority of the Prophet: He who fashioned the hearts of each of them. Jerome says that the Prophet here sufficiently indicates that God does not make soul from soul, but he creates souls one by one from nothing.
