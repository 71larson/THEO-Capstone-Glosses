# Sentences 2.30.1-7

## Chapter 1

THAT THROUGH ADAM SIN AND PUNISHMENT CAME TO HIS POSTERITY. It has been indicated in the above – if only partially, because we are not fully sufficient to the task – how the first man sinned, and what punishment he suffered for his sin. To these matters, it is to be added that sin and punishment both came to his posterity through him, as the Apostle shows by saying, Just as sin entered into this world through one man, so death also passed into all men. 

## Chapter 2

WHETHER THAT SIN WAS ORIGINAL OR ACTUAL. Here it is first to be seen what that sin was, namely whether original or actual; and if it is understood to be original, then it is next to be diligently investigated what original sin is, and why it is called original, and how it passed or passes into all.

## Chapter 3

SOME UNDERSTAND IT TO BE ACTUAL. It has pleased some to understand that text to refer to the actual sin of Adam; they say this is what the Apostle meant, since he says later: Just as through the disobedience of one man, many were made sinners, so also etc. They say that the Apostle clearly expresses, even by the term itself, the sin which through one man entered into the world, namely disobedience; but disobedience is an actual sin.

## Chapter 4

1. HOW THEY SAY THAT IT ENTERED INTO THE WORLD. And they say that it entered into the world not by the transmission of origin, but by similarity of transgression; and they say that all sinned in that one man because he was an example of sinning to all.
2. THE PELAGIANS SAY THIS. Some heretics wrongly reached this conclusion, and they are called Pelagians, whom Augustine mentions in the book On the Baptism of Children, saying, “It is to be known that some heretics, who are called Pelagians, said that the sin of the first transgression passed into other men not by propagation, but by imitation. Hence they also refuse to believe that original sin is absolved in children through baptism, because they contend no such sin exists in infants. But we say to them that, if the Apostle had wanted this sin to be understood to be one of imitation, and not of propagation, he would have named as its originator not Adam, but the devil, of whom it is said in the book of Wisdom: By the devil’s envy, death entered into the world. And because Scripture does not wish this to be understood to have been done by propagation, but by imitation, it immediately added: And they that are on his side imitate him [i.e. the devil]. Certainly, they imitate Adam as often as they transgress God’s mandate through disobedience, but it is one thing that he is an example to those who sin willingly, and another that he is the progenitor of those who are born with sin.” And so the sin of Adam is not to be taken to have passed into all only by the example of imitation, but also by the vice of propagation and origin.

## Chapter 5

HERE HE MADES EXPLICIT THAT THE SIN WHICH PASSES TO POSTERITY IS ORIGINAL SIN. As Augustine plainly attests, the original sin is that which through Adam is passed into all those who were begotten with concupiscence through his vitiated flesh.

## Chapter 6

1. HERE IT IS ASKED WHAT ORIGINAL SIN IS. And it is to be diligently investigated what it is. For the holy doctors have spoken of this very obscurely, and the doctors of the schools have reached different conclusions.
2. THE OPINION OF SOME CONCERNING ORIGINAL SIN. For some hold that original sin is a liability to punishment for the sin of the first man, that is, the debt or subjection to punishment by which we are made liable and bound to temporal and eternal punishment for the actual sin of the first man; because, they say, eternal punishment is due to all for that sin, unless they are freed through grace. – According to their view, it is fitting to say that original sin is neither fault, nor punishment. They profess that it is not fault. And according to them, it cannot be a punishment either because, if original sin is a debt of punishment, since a debt of punishment is not a punishment, original sin is not a punishment either. – Some of them even admit this, saying that in Scripture original sin is frequently called a liability; and they there understand by ‘liability’, as has been said, subjection to punishment. And for this reason they assert that original sin is said to be in children, because children are liable to punishment for that first sin, just as, according to the justice of courts, children are sometimes exiled for the sin of an evil parent.

## Chapter 7

1. HE PROVES BY AUTHORITIES THAT ORIGINAL SIN IS A FAULT. But that original sin is a fault is taught by several testimonies of the Saints. – GREGORY. Ox Exodus, where it says: The first-born of an ass you shall redeem with a sheep, Gregory says: “We have all been born in sin, and conceived from the pleasure of the flesh, we have all contracted the original fault in ourselves; so it is that we embroil ourselves in sin also by our own will.” See, he says that we contract the original fault; and so it is clear that original sin is a fault.

[…]

3. AUGUSTINE. The same, on Psalm 50: “What is sown from a dead body is born with the bond of original sin and of death. And that is why David describes himself as conceived among iniquities, because all contract from Adam iniquity and the bond of death: for no one is born without contracting punishment and the deserving of punishment.” Now, what deserves punishment is sin; and so anyone who is born through concupiscence of the flesh contracts sin.
4. Therefore, original sin is the fault which all contract who are conceived through concupiscence. […]
